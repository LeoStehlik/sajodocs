# How and Why was DeroGold Created?

DeroGold was created in December 2018 by DeroGold and TurtleCoin Developers. 

It was born from the idea that there were no projects out there focused on the environment, circular economy a sustainable housing. 
Although the initial focus was on supporting seasteading, later on in the project we realised this is too niche an potentially not completely in line
with what we wanted to achieve. Instead we focus on supporting sustainable housing and building carbon-negative buildings using the Ferrock material. 

From the technology standpoint, the DeroGold's goal is to build the technology and then let the community use it and grow it on its own. 
We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself.

DeroGold was created with **No** Pre-Mine, **No** ICO, and **No** Shenanigans.

# Our Background

Most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.

We also have a wide range of people in the community, people from all walks of life that contribute to the community one way or another. 

Our community and dev team are growing by the week and this is what makes the DeroGold community so great!
