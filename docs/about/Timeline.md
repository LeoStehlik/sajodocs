# Timeline of DeroGold

This is a timeline dedicated to important dates in the history of DeroGold.

- 2018 December
     * DeroGold was created. We launched DeroGold in December 2018 as a TurtleCoin fork. 
     * We adopted the Cryptonight-Turtle algo, which we stayed with until block 2,420,000.

- 2019 January - March
     * Our first few months we were on the block difficulty target of 10 seconds and the emission speed factor 23.
     * This was fun, as our blockchain was spitting out blocks on average every 10 seconds (quite often ever 5-6 seconds) and throwing about 12M DEGO block reward at our early miners.

- 2019 April - December
     * At block height 700,000 we have slowed down our network to 20 seconds block difficulty target and moved to emission speed factor 24. 
     * Our block reward reduced to about 5M per block, which was still fun to mine at a block target of 20 seconds.
     * The Network was lightning-fast and fun to send transactions to any user anywhere around the world.
     * This was the period of time when we started learning some of the limitations of the Cryptonote-based coins codebase - scalability issues and possible attack vectors.
     * It was a difficult time, during which we learned a lot and improved!

- 2020 January - December
     * To keep our network fair use, we decided to take the following three actions.
     * First, we slowed down our network even further to 300 seconds difficulty target. We kept the emission speed factor.
     * Second, we implemented Proof of Work for any transaction to be submitted to the network. Transactions with no or not enough PoW are rejected to enter the mempool. 
     * Third, we capped the maximum block size.
     * These three actions brought much needed stability to our network. 
     * It almost allows us to run on autopilot - little to no maintenance, focus on building the core suite, allow our users to run their own nodes again, pain-free!

- 2021 January - December
     * DeroGold algo change
     * We released v0.6.0 of our core suite software. Exciting times! 
     * We forked to the Cryptonight-UPX algo! We did so because of our commitment to sustainability, efficiency and ability to mine DeroGold on small portable and mobile devices.
     * We forked to the new algo at height 2,420,000.
     * Additionally, we implemented number of storage-saving features (no-bin files) allowing our users who run nodes to save as much as 150GB of storage space.
     * We plan for mobile wallets, API optimisations, partial codebase rewrites, so that our users and/or third-party ISVs can build their solutions on top of our core suite.

- 2022 January - December
     * DeroGold release v0.7.1 core software
     * wDEGO DEFI token contract started on TRON chain. Wider plans with the tokenisation of DeroGold will be announced throughout 2022.

- 2023 January - December
     * Rework of the core suite to work with later versions of GCC, automating builds and enabling docker builds again.

- 2024 January - December
     * Continue to reworkd the core suite, add derogold.online site to run explorer, project documentation and other API services we plan to build in 2025
