# About DeroGold

DeroGold is a digital assets project focused on preserving our life environment here on Earth. 

DeroGold aspires to solve problems such as circular economy in recycling, re-use of waste materials and how we can drive positive behaviour by rewarding people with digital assets for recycling.

DeroGold's code is forked from the TurtleCoin code - a project that is no longer with us. TurtleCoin was a fork from the Bytecoin code, and it has majorly the same privacy features you'll find in Monero and Aeon. Every transaction is private, by default.

Some of the main features of DeroGold include:

- On-chain privacy

- Only two decimal places

- Fast transactions

- Easy to mine

- Easy to use

- Amazing community

- Send to anyone, around the world
