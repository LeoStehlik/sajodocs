## What is DeroGold?

DeroGold is a digital assets project focused on preserving our life environment here on Earth. 

DeroGold aspires to solve problems such as circular economy in recycling, re-use of waste materials and how we can drive positive behaviour by rewarding people with digital assets for recycling. And build sustainable, carbon-negative buildings using Ferrock.

For simplicity, we say we are the digital "Nectar Card for Recycling".

However, we are much more than that. We run our own privacy digital asset that allows people and organisations to send and receive our native digital coins called DEGO.
