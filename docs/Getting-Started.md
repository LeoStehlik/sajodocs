# Getting Started with DeroGold

## What is DeroGold?

DeroGold is a digital assets project focused on preserving our life environment here on Earth. 

DeroGold aspires to solve problems such as circular economy in recycling, re-use of waste materials and how we can drive positive behaviour by rewarding people with digital assets for recycling. And build sustainable carbon-negative buildings using Ferrock.

For simplicity, we say we are the digital "Nectar Card for Recycling".

However, we are much more than that. We run our own privacy digital asset that allows people and organisations to send and receive our native digital coins called DEGO.  


Below is essentially a checklist of tasks you have to do to get started with DeroGold.

## 1. Setting Up a New Wallet

There are multiple types of wallets you can use with DeroGold.

To view a list of them, their interface and a brief description, as a well as guides on how to use them, you can check [this guide](../guides/wallets/Making-a-Wallet).

## 2. Start Mining DeroGold<a name="mining"></a>

Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the DeroGold network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with DEGO, our native DeroGold network coin.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!
